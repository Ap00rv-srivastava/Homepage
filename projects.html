									<p>In the first half of the project, I looked at several intriguing ideas and concepts starting with mechanisms, origami, topological insulators, form-finding, metamaterials, lattice mechanics, lattice dynamics, topological mechanics, and finally concluded with the study of mechanisms and states of self stress present inlattices, connecting all these ideas. The detailed report of the first phase of the project can be found <a href="docs/BTP_report_I.pdf">here</a>.</p>

									<p>Iâ€™m currently working towards developing a program, which will help us in studying the effect of different kinds of stimuli and tweakings in simple spring-ball models of materials.This will help us identify several ways in which connectivity can be altered, or pre-tensions can be applied to induce curvatures and different shapes and study other exciting properties such as vibrational modes and wave propagation.</p>

									<p>The project was directed towards developing design and control methodology for an adaptive bridge prototype. Adaptive structures are the one which undergo controlled shape changes to achieve a configuration which maximizes the efficiency of the structure in carrying the applied load. As a result of this improved efficiency, significant material and energy savings can be achieved.</p>

									<p>My work was addressed towards refining the control problem of the structure and making it efficient for real-time control through an iterative linear control routine. I also established the accuracy of the converged solutions through Non-linear optimization algorithms such as SQP and IPM and analytical solutions obtained using Karush-Kunh-Tucker (KKT) condition. I also helped in assembly of prototype and callibration of its sensors.</p>

									<p>Structural Optimization is defined as a discipline dealing with optimal design of load carrying structure. This project involved using Genetic Algorithm to optimize a Fiber Reinforced Plastic based structure with more than 13,000 members. Genetic Algorithm belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection.</p>

									<p>A stress ratio based design function was employed for the Genetic Algorithm. STAAD-Pro model of the structure was used to analyze the structure and the result of the analysis were stored in excel sheets using the COM (Component Object Model) object of STAAD-Pro, OpenSTAAD. The data from the sheets was processed using VB.Net and the resulting modified cross sections were transmitted to the model via OpenSTAAD. The concepts of symmetry and anti-symmetry were also employed to simplify the structure and reduce the number of design variables in the optimization problem.</p>

									<p>The acronym LEAF stands for <u>L</u>ight weight, <u>E</u>nergy efficient <u>A</u>bode for the <u>F</u>uture.The prototype model consists of an outer box, within which multiple flexible components are enclosed; this provides a large variety of spaces based on user requirements. The project strives to encourage community building and aid in self-built modular housing. Moreover, Project Leaf offers new opportunities for economic generation in small-scale households. The technical objectives of the project are directed towards developing a zero-impact house, which encompasses minimizing the energy use and negative impact that conventional buildings have on the environment. The use of renewable and natural energy resources ensures a reduction in construction and maintenance costs. Various technologies, methods, and materials have been identified to make the construction process faster and more efficient.</p>

									<p>Project solarise was aimed at building a Net-Positive, fully-functional, 1,800 sq-ft (G + 1) house designed by integrating traditional architecture with contemporary interior designs, modern lifestyle and futuristic amenities. Passive solar architecture is the central design tenet with the aim of reducing the requirement for artificial thermal and lighting control as far as possible. Integrated with the concepts of modularity and ideas for quick assembly, the design ensures that fully-furnished house can be built within 20 days. The project is aligned with the Smart Cities Mission of the Government of India in setting examples and defining standards that can be replicated both within and outside the Smart City. This project was presented in <a href="https://www.solardecathlon.gov/international-china.html">Solar Decathlon China (SDC)</a>, 2018 edition, held in Dezhou, China.</p>
