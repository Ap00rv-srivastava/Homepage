						<p>I, Apoorv Srivastava, am a senior undergraduate in the Department of <a href="https://www.civil.iitb.ac.in/">Civil Engineering</a>, <a href="iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a>. Following my interest in mathematics and physics, along with my experiences as an undergraduate, I have developed a profound interest in the area of mechanics, particularly in the area of mechanical metamaterials, active materials, and lattice mechanics. During my undergraduate years, I have worked on a few research projects which are enlisted on <a href="projects.html#research_project">here</a>. I am currently working on a project titled <a href="projects.html#metamaterials_project"><em>Mechanical Metamaterials, Non-Affine Deformations and Deployable Structures</em></a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.civil.iitb.ac.in/~minamdar/">Prof. Mandar M. Inamdar</a>. The project initially involved the study several fascinating ideas and concepts like origami, form-finding, metamaterials, mechanisms, topological mechanics and so on. Current effort is directed towards studying the behavior of spring-ball model of lattices under different stimuli.</p>

						<p>Apart from the research projects, I have worked on several academic projects as a part of the courses I have undertaken, some of these can be found <a href="projects.html#academic_project">here</a>. I have also been involved in technical projects since my sophomore years as a part of <a href="https://teamshunya.netlify.com/#"><em>Team Shunya</em></a>, an interdisciplinary technical team of IIT Bombay comprising of 50+ students working under the guidance of 9 faculty members towards developing a solution for sustainable housing by building highly efficient buildings powered by renewables. The details of the project and the work I did can be found <a href="projects.html#technical_projects">here</a>.</p>

						<p>In the summer of 2019, I worked as a research intern at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a>,Switzerland under the guidance of <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/ian.smith?lang=en">Prof. Ian F. C. Smith</a> and <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/gennaro.senatore?lang=en">Dr. Gennaro Senatore</a> on the project titled <a href="projects.html#active_structure"><em>Active Structures: Design and Control</em></a>. The project was concerned with the development of structure which adapt their geometry based on the load acting on them in order to maximize the load carrying efficiency of the structure. My work was focused towards improving the control problem and developing a linearized problem to achieve the efficiency required for real time control. I also helped in the callibration of the sensors and assembly of the structure.</p>

						<p>I was appointed as a mentor under the <a href="https://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/~smp/academics.html#damp">Department Academic Mentorship Program (DAMP)</a> in the year 2018. As a part of this program, I am helping students in the department in overcoming challenges they face during their academic and co-curricular pursuits.</p>

						<p>Other than my research, academics and responsibilities, I enjoy a broad range of hobbies, some of which can be found <a href="miscellaneous.html">here</a>.I am constantly involved in learning about a broad range of fields which span from management to mathematics.</p>
