									<p>Following the project Solarise of Team Shunya, I am serving the team as Structures and Materials Subsystem head for the project LEAF. I am heading a team of 10+ students where we are working towards developing deployable modules capable of being stored in compact shapes and deploy when needed. The group is also involved in the study of engineered materials with high strength-to-weight ratio which could reduce the weight of the structure and enhance the sustainaibility of the structure by reducing the embodied energy present in the building. As a part of this responsibility, I was also involved in defining the projects's concept, team structuring and defining the roles of team management.</p>

									<p>I joined Team Shunya in the year 2017 as a Design Engineer for the Project Solarise, which was going to be presented in the upcoming <a href="https://www.solardecathlon.gov/international-china.html">Solar Decathlon China (SDC)</a> 2018. As a Design Engineer, I was involved in designing of the load carrying structural framework and selection of material for auxiallary components of building based on embodied energy and their impact on the environmnet. I was part of the gorup of Team Shunya which represented India in <a href="https://www.solardecathlon.gov/international-china.html">Solar Decathlon China (SDC)</a> 2018 in Dezhou, China. The team built an 1800 sq-ft solar-powered fully-furnished net-positive energy house within 12 days and was awarded with the 'Best Participation Award' for its effciency and dedication during the competition. I was also involved in the documentation and deliverable preparation of the Project.</p>
