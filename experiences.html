									<p>Following the project Solarise of Team Shunya, I served the team as Structures and Materials Subsystem head for the project LEAF. I worked with a team of 10+ students towards developing deployable modules capable of being stored in compact shapes and deploy when needed. I was also involved in the study of engineered materials with high strength-to-weight ratio which could reduce the weight of the structure and enhance the sustainaibility of the structure by reducing the embodied energy present in the building. As a part of this responsibility, I was also involved in defining the projects's concept, team structuring and defining the roles of team management.</p>

									<p>I joined Team Shunya in the year 2017 as a Design Engineer for the Project Solarise, which was going to be presented in the upcoming Solar Decathlon China 2018. As a Design Engineer, I was involved in designing of the load carrying structural framework and selection of material for auxiallary components of building based on embodied energy and their impact on the environmnet. I was part of the gorup of Team Shunya which represented India in Solar Decathlon China 2018 in Dezhou, China. The team built an 1800 sq-ft solar-powered fully-furnished net-positive energy house within 12 days and was awarded with the 'Best Participation Award' for its effciency and dedication during the competition. I was also involved in the documentation and deliverable preparation of the Project.</p>
